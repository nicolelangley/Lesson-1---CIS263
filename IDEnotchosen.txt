One of the IDEs that I did not choose was Eclipse. I have used Eclipse in the past and while I am familar with it, it is one of my least favorite IDEs across any language I have used. 
I know it is a popular IDE but for some reason it has never been one I enhoy using. I was on the edge however because I was not sure if I wanted to learn one new from scratch but it 
is a risk I am taking to hopefully find one I like more.
