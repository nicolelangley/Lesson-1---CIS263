I decied to try out IntelliJ IDE for this course. My second top choice was Eclipse. I have used Eclipse in the past so that would make sense to chose again, however it is not my favorite IDE. I have used others for other languages that have so many more features then Eclipse. After reading about IntelliJ I wanted to give it a try and try something new.
